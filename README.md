# Algorithms

This file contains implementations of several algorithms presented in **"Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, and Stein**, a foundational text in computer science and algorithmic theory. These implementations adhere to the theoretical foundations discussed in the book, providing a solid basis for further study or practical use.

### Implemented Algorithms

- **Matrix Class**: Includes an implementation of the **Strassen algorithm** for efficient matrix multiplication.
- **Heaps**: Implements min-heaps, max-heaps, and **Fibonacci heaps** for efficient priority queue operations.
- **Binary Search Tree**: A standard implementation of binary search trees.
- **Linked Lists**: Includes implementations of both singly and doubly linked lists.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Various sorting algorithms such as **bubble sort**, **merge sort**, and **insertion sort**.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Examples of dynamic programming algorithms, including finding the optimal sequence for matrix chain multiplication.
- **Graph Algorithms**: A variety of graph algorithms such as:
  - **Depth-First Search (DFS)** and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
  - **Topological Sort**
  - **Kruskal's** algorithm for minimum spanning trees
  - **Bellman-Ford**, **Dijkstra's**, and **Johnson's** algorithms for shortest paths
  - **Ford-Fulkerson** for maximum flow in a network
- **Simplexe** algorithm for linear optimisation over convex bodies

### Notes

- **No test files** are currently provided for these algorithms, but each implementation is based on the rigorous descriptions found in the book.
